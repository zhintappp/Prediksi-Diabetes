# 🧠 **Diabetes Prediction with Streamlit: Early Detection of Diabetes Using Naive Bayes**

## **What is Diabetes Prediction?** 💡

Diabetes is a disease that can affect a person's quality of life. However, if detected early, more serious effects can be prevented. This app uses **Machine Learning** and **Naive Bayes** algorithm to predict whether a person is at risk of diabetes or not, based on medical factors such as age, BMI (Body Mass Index), blood pressure, insulin levels, and others. 

The aim of this app is to help early detection of diabetes risk so that preventive measures can be taken immediately to improve quality of life and prevent more serious complications.
